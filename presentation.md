Vitest comes with a UI that runs in the browser. It can show code, and even print out console.log() calls!

This might seem excessive for those who prefer the command line, but it makes for a lot of convenient things like drilling down to specific tests.

## Paragraphs of text

The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use.

Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres. They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments.

- :keyboard: **Colemak mod-DH** — The base layer is arranged in the Colemak mod-DH layout. Aside from being efficient on ortholinear keyboards, it also allows for a familiar placement of Backspace on a compact layout.

- :keyboard: **Modifier keys** — There are dedicated keys for Cmd and Opt (or Alt and Win in Windows), but Ctrl and Enter are shared by one key (tap for Enter, hold for Ctrl).

- :keyboard: **Layers** — There’s a Nav key to access numbers and arrows (a “layer” in QMK and ZMK terms). There’s a Sym key to access symbols.

## Code block

<!-- _class: side-figure -->
<!-- _header: Side figure with code -->

React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

React adheres to the <mark>declarative programming</mark> paradigm. This is in contrast with imperative.

<figure>

```javascript
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

it("works", () => {
  ReactDOM.render(<div>hello!</div>, document.body);
  expect(document.body.innerText).toBe("hello?");
});
```

> :point_up: This code block might have an error. Do you think you can find it? At least 3 people can't.

<div class="columns-2">

Use `<div class="columns-2">` to break a section up into columns. The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone in the violin family.

Most violins have a hollow wooden body. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument in the family in regular use.

</div>

```javascript
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

it("works", () => {
  ReactDOM.render(<div>hello!</div>, document.body);
  expect(document.body.innerText).toBe("hello!");
});
